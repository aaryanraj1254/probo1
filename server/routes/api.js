const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Example of a route using dynamic translations
router.get('/welcome', (req, res) => {
    // Fetch translation dynamically based on user's language
    const welcomeMessage = req.t('welcome'); // 'welcome' is the key defined in your translation JSON files
    res.json({ message: welcomeMessage });
});

router.get('/goodbye', (req, res) => {
    // Fetch translation dynamically based on user's language
    const goodbyeMessage = req.t('goodbye'); // 'goodbye' key from translation files
    res.json({ message: goodbyeMessage });
});

module.exports = router;


In short, req.t() is a function provided by a translation library like i18next, which is used for internationalization (i18n). It helps in fetching the translated string for a given key.

Here, req.t('welcome') retrieves the translation for the "welcome" key based on the user's language preference, which can be set in the request. It allows you to dynamically change the language of your application without hardcoding strings.
