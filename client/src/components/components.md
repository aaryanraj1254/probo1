Why are these components being used?

These components are being used because they:

Simplify development: By breaking down the UI into smaller components, developers can focus on specific features and work more efficiently.


Improve maintainability: Components make it easier to update and fix issues in the UI, as changes can be made to individual components without affecting the entire application.
Enhance user experience: Well-designed components can improve the overall user experience by providing a consistent and intuitive interface.





In summary, header.js and tradeform.js are components that represent specific parts of a web application's UI. They are created to promote modularity, reusability, and easier development, and are used to simplify development, improve maintainability, and enhance the user experience. â¬¤
